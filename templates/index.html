     <p class="lead">
       Retail data analytics is the process of collecting and studying retail data (like sales, inventory, pricing, etc.) to discover trends, predict outcomes, and make better, more profitable business decisions.<br>

       Done well, data analytics allows retailers to get more insight into the performance of their stores, products, customers, and vendors — and use that insight to grow profits.<br>
